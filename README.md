# ban-me-bot
This is a bot that "bans" a Discord user. When you say "ban me" to the bot, it'll respond with two words that sound similar, such as "banh mi" or something along those lines. It is totally created for fun and not to be taken seriously, and is a dive for me into dictionaries, mapping, and similar techniques.
